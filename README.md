Welcome, MyPathfinder
MyPathfinder is a simple addon designed to track progress in unlocking the Pathfinder flying achievements. It works for both Broken Isles, Draenor, Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands (WIP) Pathfinders.

MyPathfinder is fully functional as a standalone plugin and includes a minimap icon, but is optimized to run with a LibDataBroker (LDB) compatible display such as ElvUI, Bazooka, Titan Panel, or Chocolate Bar.

LibDataBroker
 

To use MyPathfinder in a LibDataBroker display, you will need to first enable the addon in your display's properties. This varies by mod

Once MyPathfinder is enabled, you can mouse over the display to see a detailed summary of your progress.

To change options, click on the LDB display while holding the corresponding mouse key (for example, Ctrl + Left Click to enable or disable tracking of Legion's Pathfinding Achievement).

You can also change the LDB display options by using the chat commands; the change will be reflected globally within Pathfinder.
